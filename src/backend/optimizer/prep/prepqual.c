 * directly underneath another AND, or OR underneath OR, if the input was

 * produce such parsetrees.  The planner wants to flatten all such cases
 * to ensure consistent optimization behavior.
 *
 * Formerly, this module was responsible for doing the initial flattening,

 * make a complete pass over the expression tree anyway.  Instead, we just
 * have to ensure that our manipulations preserve AND/OR flatness.

 * tree after local transformations that might introduce nested AND/ORs.

/*
 * negate_clause
 *	  Negate a Boolean expression.
 *
 * Input is a clause to be negated (e.g., the argument of a NOT clause).
 * Returns a new clause equivalent to the negation of the given clause.
 *
 * Although this can be invoked on its own, it's mainly intended as a helper
 * for eval_const_expressions(), and that context drives several design
 * decisions.  In particular, if the input is already AND/OR flat, we must
 * preserve that property.  We also don't bother to recurse in situations
 * where we can assume that lower-level executions of eval_const_expressions
 * would already have simplified sub-clauses of the input.
 *
 * The difference between this and a simple make_notclause() is that this
 * tries to get rid of the NOT node by logical simplification.  It's clearly
 * always a win if the NOT node can be eliminated altogether.  However, our
 * use of DeMorgan's laws could result in having more NOT nodes rather than
 * fewer.  We do that unconditionally anyway, because in WHERE clauses it's
 * important to expose as much top-level AND/OR structure as possible.
 * Also, eliminating an intermediate NOT may allow us to flatten two levels
 * of AND or OR together that we couldn't have otherwise.  Finally, one of
 * the motivations for doing this is to ensure that logically equivalent
 * expressions will be seen as physically equal(), so we should always apply
 * the same transformations.

/*
 * CNF Conversion for CTE Predicate Pushdown
 *
 * MOTIVATION:
 * When a CTE is referenced multiple times with different filter predicates,
 * we want to push down the combined predicates to reduce materialization.
 * For example:
 *
 *   WITH cte AS (SELECT ... FROM large_table)
 *   SELECT * FROM cte WHERE store_id = 10
 *   UNION ALL
 *   SELECT * FROM cte WHERE store_id = 20
 *
 * We collect predicates from all consumers and combine them:
 *   (store_id = 10) OR (store_id = 20)
 *
 * For more complex cases with AND predicates:
 *   WHERE (store_id = 10 AND year = 2001)
 *   WHERE (store_id = 20 AND year = 2001)
 *
 * Combined: (store_id = 10 AND year = 2001) OR (store_id = 20 AND year = 2001)
 *
 * WHY CNF CONVERSION:
 * CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) is required because:
 * 1. The planner expects filter predicates in AND-of-ORs form
 * 2. CNF enables individual clauses to be pushed down independently
 * 3. After CNF conversion, (year = 2001) can be extracted as a separate
 *    conjunct and pushed down even if other parts cannot be
 *
 * ALGORITHM:
 * We use the distributive law to convert OR-of-ANDs to AND-of-ORs:
 *
 *   (A AND B) OR (A AND C)
 *   = (A OR A) AND (A OR C) AND (B OR A) AND (B OR C)  [distribute]
 *   = A AND (A OR C) AND (B OR A) AND (B OR C)         [simplify A OR A = A]
 *   = A AND (A OR C) AND (A OR B) AND (B OR C)         [reorder]
 *
 * With subsumption detection, we can further simplify:
 *   - (A OR C) subsumes any clause containing all its terms plus more
 *   - So A AND (A OR C) simplifies to A (since A subsumes A OR C? No...)
 *   
 * Actually: In CNF context, (A) subsumes (A OR B) because:
 *   - If A is true, both A and (A OR B) are true
 *   - (A) is more restrictive, so (A OR B) is redundant
 *
 * EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * Input: (s='s' AND year=2001) OR (s='s' AND year=2002)
 *
 * Step 1: Identify AND clauses to distribute
 *   - First AND: (s='s' AND year=2001)
 *   - Remaining: (s='s' AND year=2002)
 *
 * Step 2: Distribute first AND over remaining
 *   - (s='s' OR (s='s' AND year=2002))  → recurse
 *   - (year=2001 OR (s='s' AND year=2002))  → recurse
 *
 * Step 3: Recursively convert each:
 *   - (s='s' OR (s='s' AND year=2002))
 *     = (s='s' OR s='s') AND (s='s' OR year=2002)
 *     = s='s' AND (s='s' OR year=2002)
 *   
 *   - (year=2001 OR (s='s' AND year=2002))
 *     = (year=2001 OR s='s') AND (year=2001 OR year=2002)
 *
 * Step 4: Combine with AND:
 *   = s='s' AND (s='s' OR year=2002) AND (year=2001 OR s='s') AND (year=2001 OR year=2002)
 *
 * Step 5: Deduplicate and remove subsumed clauses:
 *   - s='s' subsumes (s='s' OR year=2002) and (year=2001 OR s='s')
 *   - Final: s='s' AND (year=2001 OR year=2002)
 *
 * DEDUPLICATION STRATEGY:
 * 1. Exact duplicate removal: (A OR B) appears twice → keep one
 * 2. Subsumption removal: (A OR B) AND (A OR B OR C) → keep only (A OR B)
 *    because (A OR B) being true implies (A OR B OR C) is true
 *
 * COMPLEXITY NOTE:
 * CNF conversion can cause exponential blowup in the worst case.
 * For n AND-clauses each with m terms: O(m^n) output clauses.
 * The deduplication helps mitigate this for practical queries.
